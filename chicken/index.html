<h2>Why did the Chicken Cross the Road???</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<li>I tried to make frogger but with a chicken trying to cross the road instead.</li>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<li>I tried to experiment with Phaser Groups to make the roads and to make the cars. 
	Each car spawns with a different random speed for difficulty.</li>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<li>The hardest part was figuring out how groups work with making repeating images.
	 It was hard to get it exactly right, even with the example I found talking about it. 
	It was also difficult to get the collision working for the cars (it still doesn't work) because it seems that
	group collisions use different physics, while the chicken uses arcade physics. </li>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>The game that this is closest to is Frogger, where a frog hops across incoming traffic to
	 get to the other side. I borrowed the majority of <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/time/custom-timer"> this code for making the timer for the cars.</a>
	 I also used <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/groups/align-sprites-to-grid">this example</a> for making the roads.  </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A nervous chicken tries to cross the road. Why? You'll have to play to find out. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used the chicken theme. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Grouped objects with a little bit of randomness. Running and dodging mechanics. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
E for everyone
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1 minute
</li>
