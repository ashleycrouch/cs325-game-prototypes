<h2>Star-Catcher</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned more about generating group objects and timers. I learned that Phaser doesn't really have a way to
apply listeners for things that happen to an individual object from a group, so how you do that is that
when they're spawned individually, you add the properties to the object on its own. It's a little silly 
to do it this way, but it was the easiest method I could find. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Loading screen: From template-gamestate</li>
<li>Puppy image: From template-gamestate</li>
<li>Button: Phaser example <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/buttons/action-on-click">Action On Click</a></li>
<li>Basket image: self-made</li>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
No storymatic themes
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used stargazer and caught! for the mandated variety
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?

</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The basket moves using the left and right arrow keys. The player must move the basket so that they can catch
as many stars as they can before too many of them touch the bottom of the screen. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Moving the basket so that it will get to the star in time to catch it. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is more towards everyone, it's just supposed to be a game to play real quick while you're bored. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A few minutes
</li>
