<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>This game closely resembles my analog assignment, Weird Checkers.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
	A single-player twist on the classic game of checkers, with emphasis on stacking high and strategizing. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
No Storymatic theme was used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This game is supposed to be a quick game that you can play when you’re bored and have time to kill. Try to get as high of a score as you can to beat your friends and family.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There are  a few strategies players can try. One is to stack everything into one checker, but the best method seems to be spreading it out and not jumping at every chance you have to do double or triple points. New checkers only spawn one at a time, so going after every point value is sometimes not the best. Try to strategize a bit.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>
